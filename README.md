# Intro 

This repo has been copied from the official [Langchain ts starter](https://github.com/domeccleston/langchain-ts-starter/tree/main) repo as a starting point. Thank you üôè!

# A note about Open AI usage and costs

This project uses the OpenAI API to generate text, for which you need to provide an API key. While new accounts have a small amount of free credit, please remember that this API is *NOT* free to use and you can incur charges relatively quickly. 

I advise you to set up a soft and hard monthly billing limit which seeems acceptable to you [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits) before starting to play with this or any other project which uses the OpenAI APIs.

You can monitor your OpenAPI usage [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage). Note that it takes a few minutes for the usage to be updated.

Running this project ONCE as it was originally written in the [Langchain ts starter](https://github.com/domeccleston/langchain-ts-starter/tree/main) incurred the following charge:

```
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, 1 request
24 prompt + 182 completion = 206 tokens
```

At the time of writing, gpt-3.5-tubo costs $0.002 per 1000 tokens, so in the end this cost a mere 0.002 / 1000 * 206 = $0.000412. This is, effectively, nothing, but as you execute longer requests, change to more efficient models, and increase your usage, it could end up costing you money. Please be careful.


# Getting started

- Make sure that you are using node version 18+ you can check this with `node -v`.
- Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example` and filling in the values
  - For `OPENAI_API_KEY`, you need to have an OpenAI account and create an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn start` to run the program located at `./index.ts`

## Notes on dependencies

We're using tensorflow version ^3.21.0 despite version 4.5 being available. This is due to a peer dependency of `@tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder` on tensorflor ^3.6 which means we cannot install v4+.

We're using a local version of gpt4all (see the patched_dependencies directory) due to an error in the currently available npm module. As a consequence, you will not be able to install the project with npm. Please use yarn. This dependency will be replaced with the official one once the npm module is updated. 


# Examples

The goal of this project is for me to personally learn about langchain, llms, embeddings, and vector databases. As I learn, I'll be creating documented examples in the `./src/examples` directory. 

To run an individual example, you can use `ts-node`. 

Install `ts-node` and `typescript` globally:

```
npm install -g ts-node typescript
```

Now you can run the individual example using `ts-node --esm ./examples/<EXAMPLE FILE NAME>.ts`

Note that certain examples use data from the untracked `./_sources` directory. You will need to create and populate this directory yourself. I suggest copying the `./_example_sources` directory and renaming it to `./_sources` to get started. 

# Dev and build

- `npx turbo run build lint format` to run build scripts quickly in parallel
- `yarn start` to run your program


# langchain-ts-starter notes

Boilerplate to get started quickly with the [Langchain Typescript SDK](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs).

This uses the same tsconfig and build setup as the [examples repo](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs/tree/main/examples), to ensure it's in sync with the official docs.
